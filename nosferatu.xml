		Interventions

1. Interventions are planned processes designed to secure compliance with the law and include:
• Inspections and audits - including verification to test conformity with information contained in safety reports and to monitor duty holders' implementation of stated prevention, control and mitigatory measures;
• Other methods of contact such as projects;
• Interventions do not include incident and complaint investigations.

2. The Intervention Process section lists the five elements of the intervention process. This Appendix provides more detail on what each element involves. Where appropriate it provides further information on issues or refers to other sources.

Planning and preparation

- Intervention priorities;
- Deciding which topic(s) to address (see also Major Hazard Intervention Plans); Deciding on an intervention approach to use (Table 1);
- Identifying experience required for interventions (Table 1);
- Informing the duty holder (unless an unannounced visit is proposed - see below)

3. HID LD policy is to allow local inspectors a choice of whether or not to pre-arrange visits.

4. Advantages:

- Conditions found reflect the normal state of affairs;
- Can be more efficient use of inspectors' time because they can go directly from one site to another with no wasted time between appointments.

5. Disadvantages:

• In practice the ability to significantly improve conditions before an inspector's visit is very limited - companies whose health and safety performance is poor often do not know what standards apply and inspectors will readily identify duty holders' hasty attempts;

• Inspections at larger and more complex sites include a greater scrutiny of safety management issues and the systems for controlling health and safety. This involves examining documents and interviewing people in addition to observing workplace conditions. It is more effective to pre­ arrange these visits so that inspectors see the right people who are properly prepared with the relevant documents available.

6. In general, unannounced visits are appropriate at smaller, less complex sites when a relatively short, ie less than half a day's, inspection is proposed.

Carrying out the contact

• Explain inspector's role and powers (leaflet HSC14 - see below);
• Explain purpose of the intervention;
• Gain an understanding of the management structure and interview the right people, examine documents and observe workplace conditions;
• Use the appropriate intervention approach to ensure that duty holders have SMS in place for maintaining plant integrity (see below);
• Inform personnel of the outcome of the intervention; in particular any enforcement action proposed.

7. Inspectors should ensure that duty holders and their employees whom we contact for the first time are given a copy of leaflet HSC14 What to expect when a health and safety inspector calls.

8. A suggested process safety management system-based intervention approach for major hazard issues is shown in Figure 1. In this example the process is preventing loss of containment from bulk storage of flammables. The process on which to focus at any particular intervention will be informed by whatever the most significant major accident scenario is at the installation under consideration.

9. The smaller solid circles around the perimeter of the central circle represent primary risk control systems (RCS) that are relevant to controlling the process. Inspectors should examine these RCS to the extent that they feel necessary to be confident that each is adequate. For example, confirmation of adequate plant design for existing plant may require little more than confirming vessel design standards. Planned plant inspection, on the other hand, particularly for older vessels, may need to be examined in much greater detail.

10. The dotted circles represent secondary (in that they are subsets of the primary RCS but no less important in terms of control measures) RCS that are likely to be relevant. Figure 1 shows two examples linked to the maintenance RCS, though they may also be relevant to other primary RCS.

11. This inspection model is currently being developed and more detailed information will be provided in other chapters of this manual in due course.




Recording outcomes

• Confirm matters in writing;
• Complete CIS records;
• Update intervention plans.

12. The EMM provides guidance on when inspectors should send letters to duty holders. Inspectors may choose to confirm matters outside the EMM criteria at their discretion.

13. A timeline and inspection report should be completed on CIS following an inspection.

14. For interventions carried out based on intervention plans the plans should be updated following visits eg to confirm that the visit has been carried out.



Monitoring progress

• Check duty holder's progress with action required.
15. Inspectors are required to check compliance with all enforcement notices that they issue. Improvement notices should be checked as soon as possible after the date specified on the notice for compliance and in any case
within 10 days of it. The expectation is that compliance will be checked by site visit except when sufficient confirmation can be achieved by other means.

16. Audits describes the requirements for audit follow up reports.

17. Inspectors should usually seek confirmation that duty holders have complied with legal requirements and inspectors' recommendations in letters. The expectation is that this would be achieved by eg seeking written confirmation from duty holders or by telephone.



Review

• Assess effectiveness of intervention.

18. Inspectors may find it useful to review some of their interventions, perhaps using the five elements listed here as a guide, to consider whether alternative approaches could have been more effective. For trainee inspectors this will be a more formal process carried out with line managers and / or more senior colleagues.

14. For interventions carried out based on intervention plans the plans should be updated following visits eg to confirm that the visit has been carried out.



Monitoring progress

• Check duty holder's progress with action required.
15. Inspectors are required to check compliance with all enforcement notices that they issue. Improvement notices should be checked as soon as possible after the date specified on the notice for compliance and in any case
within 10 days of it. The expectation is that compliance will be checked by site visit except when sufficient confirmation can be achieved by other means.

16. Audits describes the requirements for audit follow up reports.

17. Inspectors should usually seek confirmation that duty holders have complied with legal requirements and inspectors' recommendations in letters. The expectation is that this would be achieved by eg seeking written confirmation from duty holders or by telephone.



Review

• Assess effectiveness of intervention.

18. Inspectors may find it useful to review some of their interventions, perhaps using the five elements listed here as a guide, to consider whether alternative approaches could have been more effective. For trainee inspectors this will be a more formal process carried out with line managers and / or more senior colleagues.
		 
		Interventions

1. Interventions are planned processes designed to secure compliance with the law and include:
• Inspections and audits - including verification to test conformity with information contained in safety reports and to monitor duty holders' implementation of stated prevention, control and mitigatory measures;
• Other methods of contact such as projects;
• Interventions do not include incident and complaint investigations.

2. The Intervention Process section lists the five elements of the intervention process. This Appendix provides more detail on what each element involves. Where appropriate it provides further information on issues or refers to other sources.

Planning and preparation

- Intervention priorities;
- Deciding which topic(s) to address (see also Major Hazard Intervention Plans); Deciding on an intervention approach to use (Table 1);
- Identifying experience required for interventions (Table 1);
- Informing the duty holder (unless an unannounced visit is proposed - see below)

3. HID LD policy is to allow local inspectors a choice of whether or not to pre-arrange visits.

4. Advantages:

- Conditions found reflect the normal state of affairs;
- Can be more efficient use of inspectors' time because they can go directly from one site to another with no wasted time between appointments.

5. Disadvantages:

• In practice the ability to significantly improve conditions before an inspector's visit is very limited - companies whose health and safety performance is poor often do not know what standards apply and inspectors will readily identify duty holders' hasty attempts;

• Inspections at larger and more complex sites include a greater scrutiny of safety management issues and the systems for controlling health and safety. This involves examining documents and interviewing people in addition to observing workplace conditions. It is more effective to pre­ arrange these visits so that inspectors see the right people who are properly prepared with the relevant documents available.

6. In general, unannounced visits are appropriate at smaller, less complex sites when a relatively short, ie less than half a day's, inspection is proposed.

Carrying out the contact

• Explain inspector's role and powers (leaflet HSC14 - see below);
• Explain purpose of the intervention;
• Gain an understanding of the management structure and interview the right people, examine documents and observe workplace conditions;
• Use the appropriate intervention approach to ensure that duty holders have SMS in place for maintaining plant integrity (see below);
• Inform personnel of the outcome of the intervention; in particular any enforcement action proposed.

7. Inspectors should ensure that duty holders and their employees whom we contact for the first time are given a copy of leaflet HSC14 What to expect when a health and safety inspector calls.

8. A suggested process safety management system-based intervention approach for major hazard issues is shown in Figure 1. In this example the process is preventing loss of containment from bulk storage of flammables. The process on which to focus at any particular intervention will be informed by whatever the most significant major accident scenario is at the installation under consideration.

9. The smaller solid circles around the perimeter of the central circle represent primary risk control systems (RCS) that are relevant to controlling the process. Inspectors should examine these RCS to the extent that they feel necessary to be confident that each is adequate. For example, confirmation of adequate plant design for existing plant may require little more than confirming vessel design standards. Planned plant inspection, on the other hand, particularly for older vessels, may need to be examined in much greater detail.

10. The dotted circles represent secondary (in that they are subsets of the primary RCS but no less important in terms of control measures) RCS that are likely to be relevant. Figure 1 shows two examples linked to the maintenance RCS, though they may also be relevant to other primary RCS.

11. This inspection model is currently being developed and more detailed information will be provided in other chapters of this manual in due course.

9. The smaller solid circles around the perimeter of the central circle represent primary risk control systems (RCS) that are relevant to controlling the process. Inspectors should examine these RCS to the extent that they feel necessary to be confident that each is adequate. For example, confirmation of adequate plant design for existing plant may require little more than confirming vessel design standards. Planned plant inspection, on the other hand, particularly for older vessels, may need to be examined in much greater detail.

10. The dotted circles represent secondary (in that they are subsets of the primary RCS but no less important in terms of control measures) RCS that are likely to be relevant. Figure 1 shows two examples linked to the maintenance RCS, though they may also be relevant to other primary RCS.

Recording outcomes

• Confirm matters in writing;
• Complete CIS records;
• Update intervention plans.

12. The EMM provides guidance on when inspectors should send letters to duty holders. Inspectors may choose to confirm matters outside the EMM criteria at their discretion.

13. A timeline and inspection report should be completed on CIS following an inspection.

14. For interventions carried out based on intervention plans the plans should be updated following visits eg to confirm that the visit has been carried out.



Monitoring progress

• Check duty holder's progress with action required.
15. Inspectors are required to check compliance with all enforcement notices that they issue. Improvement notices should be checked as soon as possible after the date specified on the notice for compliance and in any case
within 10 days of it. The expectation is that compliance will be checked by site visit except when sufficient confirmation can be achieved by other means.

16. Audits describes the requirements for audit follow up reports.

17. Inspectors should usually seek confirmation that duty holders have complied with legal requirements and inspectors' recommendations in letters. The expectation is that this would be achieved by eg seeking written confirmation from duty holders or by telephone.



Review

• Assess effectiveness of intervention.

18. Inspectors may find it useful to review some of their interventions, perhaps using the five elements listed here as a guide, to consider whether alternative approaches could have been more effective. For trainee inspectors this will be a more formal process carried out with line managers and / or more senior colleagues.
		 
		Interventions

1. Interventions are planned processes designed to secure compliance with the law and include:
• Inspections and audits - including verification to test conformity with information contained in safety reports and to monitor duty holders' implementation of stated prevention, control and mitigatory measures;
• Other methods of contact such as projects;
• Interventions do not include incident and complaint investigations.

2. The Intervention Process section lists the five elements of the intervention process. This Appendix provides more detail on what each element involves. Where appropriate it provides further information on issues or refers to other sources.

Planning and preparation

- Intervention priorities;
- Deciding which topic(s) to address (see also Major Hazard Intervention Plans); Deciding on an intervention approach to use (Table 1);
- Identifying experience required for interventions (Table 1);
- Informing the duty holder (unless an unannounced visit is proposed - see below)

3. HID LD policy is to allow local inspectors a choice of whether or not to pre-arrange visits.

4. Advantages:

- Conditions found reflect the normal state of affairs;
- Can be more efficient use of inspectors' time because they can go directly from one site to another with no wasted time between appointments.

5. Disadvantages:

• In practice the ability to significantly improve conditions before an inspector's visit is very limited - companies whose health and safety performance is poor often do not know what standards apply and inspectors will readily identify duty holders' hasty attempts;

• Inspections at larger and more complex sites include a greater scrutiny of safety management issues and the systems for controlling health and safety. This involves examining documents and interviewing people in addition to observing workplace conditions. It is more effective to pre­ arrange these visits so that inspectors see the right people who are properly prepared with the relevant documents available.

6. In general, unannounced visits are appropriate at smaller, less complex sites when a relatively short, ie less than half a day's, inspection is proposed.

Carrying out the contact

• Explain inspector's role and powers (leaflet HSC14 - see below);
• Explain purpose of the intervention;
• Gain an understanding of the management structure and interview the right people, examine documents and observe workplace conditions;
• Use the appropriate intervention approach to ensure that duty holders have SMS in place for maintaining plant integrity (see below);
• Inform personnel of the outcome of the intervention; in particular any enforcement action proposed.

7. Inspectors should ensure that duty holders and their employees whom we contact for the first time are given a copy of leaflet HSC14 What to expect when a health and safety inspector calls.

8. A suggested process safety management system-based intervention approach for major hazard issues is shown in Figure 1. In this example the process is preventing loss of containment from bulk storage of flammables. The process on which to focus at any particular intervention will be informed by whatever the most significant major accident scenario is at the installation under consideration.

It is more effective to pre­ arrange these visits so that inspectors see the right people who are properly prepared with the relevant documents available.

6. In general, unannounced visits are appropriate at smaller, less complex sites when a relatively short, ie less than half a day's, inspection is proposed.

Carrying out the contact

• Explain inspector's role and powers (leaflet HSC14 - see below);
• Explain purpose of the intervention;
• Gain an understanding of the management structure and interview the right people, examine documents and observe workplace conditions;
• Use the appropriate intervention approach to ensure that duty holders have SMS in place for maintaining plant integrity (see below);
• Inform personnel of the outcome of the intervention; in particular any enforcement action proposed.

7. Inspectors should ensure that duty holders and their employees whom we contact for the first time are given a copy of leaflet HSC14 What to expect when a health and safety inspector calls.

8. A suggested process safety management system-based intervention approach for major hazard issues is shown in Figure 1. In this example the process is preventing loss of containment from bulk storage of flammables. The process on which to focus at any particular intervention will be informed by whatever the most significant major accident scenario is at the installation under consideration.

9. The smaller solid circles around the perimeter of the central circle represent primary risk control systems (RCS) that are relevant to controlling the process. Inspectors should examine these RCS to the extent that they feel necessary to be confident that each is adequate. For example, confirmation of adequate plant design for existing plant may require little more than confirming vessel design standards. Planned plant inspection, on the other hand, particularly for older vessels, may need to be examined in much greater detail.

10. The dotted circles represent secondary (in that they are subsets of the primary RCS but no less important in terms of control measures) RCS that are likely to be relevant. Figure 1 shows two examples linked to the maintenance RCS, though they may also be relevant to other primary RCS.

11. This inspection model is currently being developed and more detailed information will be provided in other chapters of this manual in due course.




Recording outcomes

• Confirm matters in writing;
• Complete CIS records;
• Update intervention plans.

12. The EMM provides guidance on when inspectors should send letters to duty holders. Inspectors may choose to confirm matters outside the EMM criteria at their discretion.

13. A timeline and inspection report should be completed on CIS following an inspection.

14. For interventions carried out based on intervention plans the plans should be updated following visits eg to confirm that the visit has been carried out.



Monitoring progress

• Check duty holder's progress with action required.
15. Inspectors are required to check compliance with all enforcement notices that they issue. Improvement notices should be checked as soon as possible after the date specified on the notice for compliance and in any case
within 10 days of it. The expectation is that compliance will be checked by site visit except when sufficient confirmation can be achieved by other means.

16. Audits describes the requirements for audit follow up reports.

17. Inspectors should usually seek confirmation that duty holders have complied with legal requirements and inspectors' recommendations in letters. The expectation is that this would be achieved by eg seeking written confirmation from duty holders or by telephone.



Review

• Assess effectiveness of intervention.

18. Inspectors may find it useful to review some of their interventions, perhaps using the five elements listed here as a guide, to consider whether alternative approaches could have been more effective. For trainee inspectors this will be a more formal process carried out with line managers and / or more senior colleagues.
		 
		Interventions

1. Interventions are planned processes designed to secure compliance with the law and include:
• Inspections and audits - including verification to test conformity with information contained in safety reports and to monitor duty holders' implementation of stated prevention, control and mitigatory measures;
• Other methods of contact such as projects;
• Interventions do not include incident and complaint investigations.

2. The Intervention Process section lists the five elements of the intervention process. This Appendix provides more detail on what each element involves. Where appropriate it provides further information on issues or refers to other sources.

Planning and preparation

- Intervention priorities;
- Deciding which topic(s) to address (see also Major Hazard Intervention Plans); Deciding on an intervention approach to use (Table 1);
- Identifying experience required for interventions (Table 1);
- Informing the duty holder (unless an unannounced visit is proposed - see below)

3. HID LD policy is to allow local inspectors a choice of whether or not to pre-arrange visits.

4. Advantages:

- Conditions found reflect the normal state of affairs;
- Can be more efficient use of inspectors' time because they can go directly from one site to another with no wasted time between appointments.

5. Disadvantages:

• In practice the ability to significantly improve conditions before an inspector's visit is very limited - companies whose health and safety performance is poor often do not know what standards apply and inspectors will readily identify duty holders' hasty attempts;

• Inspections at larger and more complex sites include a greater scrutiny of safety management issues and the systems for controlling health and safety. This involves examining documents and interviewing people in addition to observing workplace conditions.

- Deciding which topic(s) to address (see also Major Hazard Intervention Plans); Deciding on an intervention approach to use (Table 1);
- Identifying experience required for interventions (Table 1);
- Informing the duty holder (unless an unannounced visit is proposed - see below)

3. HID LD policy is to allow local inspectors a choice of whether or not to pre-arrange visits.

4. Advantages:

- Conditions found reflect the normal state of affairs;
- Can be more efficient use of inspectors' time because they can go directly from one site to another with no wasted time between appointments.

5. Disadvantages:

• In practice the ability to significantly improve conditions before an inspector's visit is very limited - companies whose health and safety performance is poor often do not know what standards apply and inspectors will readily identify duty holders' hasty attempts;

• Inspections at larger and more complex sites include a greater scrutiny of safety management issues and the systems for controlling health and safety. This involves examining documents and interviewing people in addition to observing workplace conditions. It is more effective to pre­ arrange these visits so that inspectors see the right people who are properly prepared with the relevant documents available.

6. In general, unannounced visits are appropriate at smaller, less complex sites when a relatively short, ie less than half a day's, inspection is proposed.

Carrying out the contact

• Explain inspector's role and powers (leaflet HSC14 - see below);
• Explain purpose of the intervention;
• Gain an understanding of the management structure and interview the right people, examine documents and observe workplace conditions;
• Use the appropriate intervention approach to ensure that duty holders have SMS in place for maintaining plant integrity (see below);
• Inform personnel of the outcome of the intervention; in particular any enforcement action proposed.

7. Inspectors should ensure that duty holders and their employees whom we contact for the first time are given a copy of leaflet HSC14 What to expect when a health and safety inspector calls.

8. A suggested process safety management system-based intervention approach for major hazard issues is shown in Figure 1. In this example the process is preventing loss of containment from bulk storage of flammables. The process on which to focus at any particular intervention will be informed by whatever the most significant major accident scenario is at the installation under consideration.

9. The smaller solid circles around the perimeter of the central circle represent primary risk control systems (RCS) that are relevant to controlling the process. Inspectors should examine these RCS to the extent that they feel necessary to be confident that each is adequate. For example, confirmation of adequate plant design for existing plant may require little more than confirming vessel design standards. Planned plant inspection, on the other hand, particularly for older vessels, may need to be examined in much greater detail.

10. The dotted circles represent secondary (in that they are subsets of the primary RCS but no less important in terms of control measures) RCS that are likely to be relevant. Figure 1 shows two examples linked to the maintenance RCS, though they may also be relevant to other primary RCS.

11. This inspection model is currently being developed and more detailed information will be provided in other chapters of this manual in due course.




Recording outcomes

• Confirm matters in writing;
• Complete CIS records;
• Update intervention plans.

12. The EMM provides guidance on when inspectors should send letters to duty holders. Inspectors may choose to confirm matters outside the EMM criteria at their discretion.

13. A timeline and inspection report should be completed on CIS following an inspection.

14. For interventions carried out based on intervention plans the plans should be updated following visits eg to confirm that the visit has been carried out.



Monitoring progress

• Check duty holder's progress with action required.
15. Inspectors are required to check compliance with all enforcement notices that they issue. Improvement notices should be checked as soon as possible after the date specified on the notice for compliance and in any case
within 10 days of it. The expectation is that compliance will be checked by site visit except when sufficient confirmation can be achieved by other means.

16. Audits describes the requirements for audit follow up reports.

17. Inspectors should usually seek confirmation that duty holders have complied with legal requirements and inspectors' recommendations in letters. The expectation is that this would be achieved by eg seeking written confirmation from duty holders or by telephone.



Review

• Assess effectiveness of intervention.

18. Inspectors may find it useful to review some of their interventions, perhaps using the five elements listed here as a guide, to consider whether alternative approaches could have been more effective. For trainee inspectors this will be a more formal process carried out with line managers and / or more senior colleagues.
		 
		Interventions

1. Interventions are planned processes designed to secure compliance with the law and include:
• Inspections and audits - including verification to test conformity with information contained in safety reports and to monitor duty holders' implementation of stated prevention, control and mitigatory measures;
• Other methods of contact such as projects;
• Interventions do not include incident and complaint investigations.

2. The Intervention Process section lists the five elements of the intervention process. This Appendix provides more detail on what each element involves. Where appropriate it provides further information on issues or refers to other sources.

Inspectors may find it useful to review some of their interventions, perhaps using the five elements listed here as a guide, to consider whether alternative approaches could have been more effective. For trainee inspectors this will be a more formal process carried out with line managers and / or more senior colleagues.
		 
		Interventions

1. Interventions are planned processes designed to secure compliance with the law and include:
• Inspections and audits - including verification to test conformity with information contained in safety reports and to monitor duty holders' implementation of stated prevention, control and mitigatory measures;
• Other methods of contact such as projects;
• Interventions do not include incident and complaint investigations.

2. The Intervention Process section lists the five elements of the intervention process. This Appendix provides more detail on what each element involves. Where appropriate it provides further information on issues or refers to other sources.

Planning and preparation

- Intervention priorities;
- Deciding which topic(s) to address (see also Major Hazard Intervention Plans); Deciding on an intervention approach to use (Table 1);
- Identifying experience required for interventions (Table 1);
- Informing the duty holder (unless an unannounced visit is proposed - see below)

3. HID LD policy is to allow local inspectors a choice of whether or not to pre-arrange visits.

4. Advantages:

- Conditions found reflect the normal state of affairs;
- Can be more efficient use of inspectors' time because they can go directly from one site to another with no wasted time between appointments.

5. Disadvantages:

• In practice the ability to significantly improve conditions before an inspector's visit is very limited - companies whose health and safety performance is poor often do not know what standards apply and inspectors will readily identify duty holders' hasty attempts;

• Inspections at larger and more complex sites include a greater scrutiny of safety management issues and the systems for controlling health and safety. This involves examining documents and interviewing people in addition to observing workplace conditions. It is more effective to pre­ arrange these visits so that inspectors see the right people who are properly prepared with the relevant documents available.

6. In general, unannounced visits are appropriate at smaller, less complex sites when a relatively short, ie less than half a day's, inspection is proposed.

Carrying out the contact

• Explain inspector's role and powers (leaflet HSC14 - see below);
• Explain purpose of the intervention;
• Gain an understanding of the management structure and interview the right people, examine documents and observe workplace conditions;
• Use the appropriate intervention approach to ensure that duty holders have SMS in place for maintaining plant integrity (see below);
• Inform personnel of the outcome of the intervention; in particular any enforcement action proposed.

7. Inspectors should ensure that duty holders and their employees whom we contact for the first time are given a copy of leaflet HSC14 What to expect when a health and safety inspector calls.

8. A suggested process safety management system-based intervention approach for major hazard issues is shown in Figure 1. In this example the process is preventing loss of containment from bulk storage of flammables. The process on which to focus at any particular intervention will be informed by whatever the most significant major accident scenario is at the installation under consideration.

9. The smaller solid circles around the perimeter of the central circle represent primary risk control systems (RCS) that are relevant to controlling the process. Inspectors should examine these RCS to the extent that they feel necessary to be confident that each is adequate. For example, confirmation of adequate plant design for existing plant may require little more than confirming vessel design standards. Planned plant inspection, on the other hand, particularly for older vessels, may need to be examined in much greater detail.

10. The dotted circles represent secondary (in that they are subsets of the primary RCS but no less important in terms of control measures) RCS that are likely to be relevant. Figure 1 shows two examples linked to the maintenance RCS, though they may also be relevant to other primary RCS.

11. This inspection model is currently being developed and more detailed information will be provided in other chapters of this manual in due course.




Recording outcomes

• Confirm matters in writing;
• Complete CIS records;
• Update intervention plans.

12. The EMM provides guidance on when inspectors should send letters to duty holders. Inspectors may choose to confirm matters outside the EMM criteria at their discretion.

13. A timeline and inspection report should be completed on CIS following an inspection.

14. For interventions carried out based on intervention plans the plans should be updated following visits eg to confirm that the visit has been carried out.



Monitoring progress

• Check duty holder's progress with action required.
15. Inspectors are required to check compliance with all enforcement notices that they issue. Improvement notices should be checked as soon as possible after the date specified on the notice for compliance and in any case
within 10 days of it. The expectation is that compliance will be checked by site visit except when sufficient confirmation can be achieved by other means.

16. Audits describes the requirements for audit follow up reports.

17. Inspectors should usually seek confirmation that duty holders have complied with legal requirements and inspectors' recommendations in letters. The expectation is that this would be achieved by eg seeking written confirmation from duty holders or by telephone.

14. For interventions carried out based on intervention plans the plans should be updated following visits eg to confirm that the visit has been carried out.



Monitoring progress

• Check duty holder's progress with action required.
15. Inspectors are required to check compliance with all enforcement notices that they issue. Improvement notices should be checked as soon as possible after the date specified on the notice for compliance and in any case
within 10 days of it. The expectation is that compliance will be checked by site visit except when sufficient confirmation can be achieved by other means.

16. Audits describes the requirements for audit follow up reports.

17. Inspectors should usually seek confirmation that duty holders have complied with legal requirements and inspectors' recommendations in letters. The expectation is that this would be achieved by eg seeking written confirmation from duty holders or by telephone.



Review

• Assess effectiveness of intervention.

18. Inspectors may find it useful to review some of their interventions, perhaps using the five elements listed here as a guide, to consider whether alternative approaches could have been more effective. For trainee inspectors this will be a more formal process carried out with line managers and / or more senior colleagues.
		 
		Interventions

1. Interventions are planned processes designed to secure compliance with the law and include:
• Inspections and audits - including verification to test conformity with information contained in safety reports and to monitor duty holders' implementation of stated prevention, control and mitigatory measures;
• Other methods of contact such as projects;
• Interventions do not include incident and complaint investigations.

2. The Intervention Process section lists the five elements of the intervention process. This Appendix provides more detail on what each element involves. Where appropriate it provides further information on issues or refers to other sources.

Planning and preparation

- Intervention priorities;
- Deciding which topic(s) to address (see also Major Hazard Intervention Plans); Deciding on an intervention approach to use (Table 1);
- Identifying experience required for interventions (Table 1);
- Informing the duty holder (unless an unannounced visit is proposed - see below)

3. HID LD policy is to allow local inspectors a choice of whether or not to pre-arrange visits.

4. Advantages:

- Conditions found reflect the normal state of affairs;
- Can be more efficient use of inspectors' time because they can go directly from one site to another with no wasted time between appointments.

5. Disadvantages:

• In practice the ability to significantly improve conditions before an inspector's visit is very limited - companies whose health and safety performance is poor often do not know what standards apply and inspectors will readily identify duty holders' hasty attempts;

• Inspections at larger and more complex sites include a greater scrutiny of safety management issues and the systems for controlling health and safety. This involves examining documents and interviewing people in addition to observing workplace conditions. It is more effective to pre­ arrange these visits so that inspectors see the right people who are properly prepared with the relevant documents available.

6. In general, unannounced visits are appropriate at smaller, less complex sites when a relatively short, ie less than half a day's, inspection is proposed.

Carrying out the contact

• Explain inspector's role and powers (leaflet HSC14 - see below);
• Explain purpose of the intervention;
• Gain an understanding of the management structure and interview the right people, examine documents and observe workplace conditions;
• Use the appropriate intervention approach to ensure that duty holders have SMS in place for maintaining plant integrity (see below);
• Inform personnel of the outcome of the intervention; in particular any enforcement action proposed.

7. Inspectors should ensure that duty holders and their employees whom we contact for the first time are given a copy of leaflet HSC14 What to expect when a health and safety inspector calls.

8. A suggested process safety management system-based intervention approach for major hazard issues is shown in Figure 1. In this example the process is preventing loss of containment from bulk storage of flammables. The process on which to focus at any particular intervention will be informed by whatever the most significant major accident scenario is at the installation under consideration.

9. The smaller solid circles around the perimeter of the central circle represent primary risk control systems (RCS) that are relevant to controlling the process. Inspectors should examine these RCS to the extent that they feel necessary to be confident that each is adequate. For example, confirmation of adequate plant design for existing plant may require little more than confirming vessel design standards. Planned plant inspection, on the other hand, particularly for older vessels, may need to be examined in much greater detail.

10. The dotted circles represent secondary (in that they are subsets of the primary RCS but no less important in terms of control measures) RCS that are likely to be relevant. Figure 1 shows two examples linked to the maintenance RCS, though they may also be relevant to other primary RCS.

11. This inspection model is currently being developed and more detailed information will be provided in other chapters of this manual in due course.

The process on which to focus at any particular intervention will be informed by whatever the most significant major accident scenario is at the installation under consideration.

9. The smaller solid circles around the perimeter of the central circle represent primary risk control systems (RCS) that are relevant to controlling the process. Inspectors should examine these RCS to the extent that they feel necessary to be confident that each is adequate. For example, confirmation of adequate plant design for existing plant may require little more than confirming vessel design standards. Planned plant inspection, on the other hand, particularly for older vessels, may need to be examined in much greater detail.

10. The dotted circles represent secondary (in that they are subsets of the primary RCS but no less important in terms of control measures) RCS that are likely to be relevant. Figure 1 shows two examples linked to the maintenance RCS, though they may also be relevant to other primary RCS.

11. This inspection model is currently being developed and more detailed information will be provided in other chapters of this manual in due course.




Recording outcomes

• Confirm matters in writing;
• Complete CIS records;
• Update intervention plans.

12. The EMM provides guidance on when inspectors should send letters to duty holders. Inspectors may choose to confirm matters outside the EMM criteria at their discretion.

13. A timeline and inspection report should be completed on CIS following an inspection.

14. For interventions carried out based on intervention plans the plans should be updated following visits eg to confirm that the visit has been carried out.



Monitoring progress

• Check duty holder's progress with action required.
15. Inspectors are required to check compliance with all enforcement notices that they issue. Improvement notices should be checked as soon as possible after the date specified on the notice for compliance and in any case
within 10 days of it. The expectation is that compliance will be checked by site visit except when sufficient confirmation can be achieved by other means.

16. Audits describes the requirements for audit follow up reports.

17. Inspectors should usually seek confirmation that duty holders have complied with legal requirements and inspectors' recommendations in letters. The expectation is that this would be achieved by eg seeking written confirmation from duty holders or by telephone.



Review

• Assess effectiveness of intervention.

18. Inspectors may find it useful to review some of their interventions, perhaps using the five elements listed here as a guide, to consider whether alternative approaches could have been more effective. For trainee inspectors this will be a more formal process carried out with line managers and / or more senior colleagues.
		 
		Interventions

1. Interventions are planned processes designed to secure compliance with the law and include:
• Inspections and audits - including verification to test conformity with information contained in safety reports and to monitor duty holders' implementation of stated prevention, control and mitigatory measures;
• Other methods of contact such as projects;
• Interventions do not include incident and complaint investigations.

2. The Intervention Process section lists the five elements of the intervention process. This Appendix provides more detail on what each element involves. Where appropriate it provides further information on issues or refers to other sources.

Planning and preparation

- Intervention priorities;
- Deciding which topic(s) to address (see also Major Hazard Intervention Plans); Deciding on an intervention approach to use (Table 1);
- Identifying experience required for interventions (Table 1);
- Informing the duty holder (unless an unannounced visit is proposed - see below)

3. HID LD policy is to allow local inspectors a choice of whether or not to pre-arrange visits.

4. Advantages:

- Conditions found reflect the normal state of affairs;
- Can be more efficient use of inspectors' time because they can go directly from one site to another with no wasted time between appointments.

5. Disadvantages:

• In practice the ability to significantly improve conditions before an inspector's visit is very limited - companies whose health and safety performance is poor often do not know what standards apply and inspectors will readily identify duty holders' hasty attempts;

• Inspections at larger and more complex sites include a greater scrutiny of safety management issues and the systems for controlling health and safety. This involves examining documents and interviewing people in addition to observing workplace conditions. It is more effective to pre­ arrange these visits so that inspectors see the right people who are properly prepared with the relevant documents available.

6. In general, unannounced visits are appropriate at smaller, less complex sites when a relatively short, ie less than half a day's, inspection is proposed.

Carrying out the contact

• Explain inspector's role and powers (leaflet HSC14 - see below);
• Explain purpose of the intervention;
• Gain an understanding of the management structure and interview the right people, examine documents and observe workplace conditions;
• Use the appropriate intervention approach to ensure that duty holders have SMS in place for maintaining plant integrity (see below);
• Inform personnel of the outcome of the intervention; in particular any enforcement action proposed.

7. Inspectors should ensure that duty holders and their employees whom we contact for the first time are given a copy of leaflet HSC14 What to expect when a health and safety inspector calls.

It is more effective to pre­ arrange these visits so that inspectors see the right people who are properly prepared with the relevant documents available.

6. In general, unannounced visits are appropriate at smaller, less complex sites when a relatively short, ie less than half a day's, inspection is proposed.

Carrying out the contact

• Explain inspector's role and powers (leaflet HSC14 - see below);
• Explain purpose of the intervention;
• Gain an understanding of the management structure and interview the right people, examine documents and observe workplace conditions;
• Use the appropriate intervention approach to ensure that duty holders have SMS in place for maintaining plant integrity (see below);
• Inform personnel of the outcome of the intervention; in particular any enforcement action proposed.

7. Inspectors should ensure that duty holders and their employees whom we contact for the first time are given a copy of leaflet HSC14 What to expect when a health and safety inspector calls.

8. A suggested process safety management system-based intervention approach for major hazard issues is shown in Figure 1. In this example the process is preventing loss of containment from bulk storage of flammables. The process on which to focus at any particular intervention will be informed by whatever the most significant major accident scenario is at the installation under consideration.

9. The smaller solid circles around the perimeter of the central circle represent primary risk control systems (RCS) that are relevant to controlling the process. Inspectors should examine these RCS to the extent that they feel necessary to be confident that each is adequate. For example, confirmation of adequate plant design for existing plant may require little more than confirming vessel design standards. Planned plant inspection, on the other hand, particularly for older vessels, may need to be examined in much greater detail.

10. The dotted circles represent secondary (in that they are subsets of the primary RCS but no less important in terms of control measures) RCS that are likely to be relevant. Figure 1 shows two examples linked to the maintenance RCS, though they may also be relevant to other primary RCS.

11. This inspection model is currently being developed and more detailed information will be provided in other chapters of this manual in due course.




Recording outcomes

• Confirm matters in writing;
• Complete CIS records;
• Update intervention plans.

12. The EMM provides guidance on when inspectors should send letters to duty holders. Inspectors may choose to confirm matters outside the EMM criteria at their discretion.

13. A timeline and inspection report should be completed on CIS following an inspection.

14. For interventions carried out based on intervention plans the plans should be updated following visits eg to confirm that the visit has been carried out.



Monitoring progress

• Check duty holder's progress with action required.
15. Inspectors are required to check compliance with all enforcement notices that they issue. Improvement notices should be checked as soon as possible after the date specified on the notice for compliance and in any case
within 10 days of it. The expectation is that compliance will be checked by site visit except when sufficient confirmation can be achieved by other means.

16. Audits describes the requirements for audit follow up reports.

17. Inspectors should usually seek confirmation that duty holders have complied with legal requirements and inspectors' recommendations in letters. The expectation is that this would be achieved by eg seeking written confirmation from duty holders or by telephone.



Review

• Assess effectiveness of intervention.

18. Inspectors may find it useful to review some of their interventions, perhaps using the five elements listed here as a guide, to consider whether alternative approaches could have been more effective. For trainee inspectors this will be a more formal process carried out with line managers and / or more senior colleagues.
		 
		Interventions

1. Interventions are planned processes designed to secure compliance with the law and include:
• Inspections and audits - including verification to test conformity with information contained in safety reports and to monitor duty holders' implementation of stated prevention, control and mitigatory measures;
• Other methods of contact such as projects;
• Interventions do not include incident and complaint investigations.

2. The Intervention Process section lists the five elements of the intervention process. This Appendix provides more detail on what each element involves. Where appropriate it provides further information on issues or refers to other sources.

Planning and preparation

- Intervention priorities;
- Deciding which topic(s) to address (see also Major Hazard Intervention Plans); Deciding on an intervention approach to use (Table 1);
- Identifying experience required for interventions (Table 1);
- Informing the duty holder (unless an unannounced visit is proposed - see below)

3. HID LD policy is to allow local inspectors a choice of whether or not to pre-arrange visits.

4. Advantages:

- Conditions found reflect the normal state of affairs;
- Can be more efficient use of inspectors' time because they can go directly from one site to another with no wasted time between appointments.

5. Disadvantages:

• In practice the ability to significantly improve conditions before an inspector's visit is very limited - companies whose health and safety performance is poor often do not know what standards apply and inspectors will readily identify duty holders' hasty attempts;

• Inspections at larger and more complex sites include a greater scrutiny of safety management issues and the systems for controlling health and safety. This involves examining documents and interviewing people in addition to observing workplace conditions.

2. The Intervention Process section lists the five elements of the intervention process. This Appendix provides more detail on what each element involves. Where appropriate it provides further information on issues or refers to other sources.

Planning and preparation

- Intervention priorities;
- Deciding which topic(s) to address (see also Major Hazard Intervention Plans); Deciding on an intervention approach to use (Table 1);
- Identifying experience required for interventions (Table 1);
- Informing the duty holder (unless an unannounced visit is proposed - see below)

3. HID LD policy is to allow local inspectors a choice of whether or not to pre-arrange visits.

4. Advantages:

- Conditions found reflect the normal state of affairs;
- Can be more efficient use of inspectors' time because they can go directly from one site to another with no wasted time between appointments.

5. Disadvantages:

• In practice the ability to significantly improve conditions before an inspector's visit is very limited - companies whose health and safety performance is poor often do not know what standards apply and inspectors will readily identify duty holders' hasty attempts;

• Inspections at larger and more complex sites include a greater scrutiny of safety management issues and the systems for controlling health and safety. This involves examining documents and interviewing people in addition to observing workplace conditions. It is more effective to pre­ arrange these visits so that inspectors see the right people who are properly prepared with the relevant documents available.

6. In general, unannounced visits are appropriate at smaller, less complex sites when a relatively short, ie less than half a day's, inspection is proposed.

Carrying out the contact

• Explain inspector's role and powers (leaflet HSC14 - see below);
• Explain purpose of the intervention;
• Gain an understanding of the management structure and interview the right people, examine documents and observe workplace conditions;
• Use the appropriate intervention approach to ensure that duty holders have SMS in place for maintaining plant integrity (see below);
• Inform personnel of the outcome of the intervention; in particular any enforcement action proposed.

7. Inspectors should ensure that duty holders and their employees whom we contact for the first time are given a copy of leaflet HSC14 What to expect when a health and safety inspector calls.

8. A suggested process safety management system-based intervention approach for major hazard issues is shown in Figure 1. In this example the process is preventing loss of containment from bulk storage of flammables. The process on which to focus at any particular intervention will be informed by whatever the most significant major accident scenario is at the installation under consideration.

9. The smaller solid circles around the perimeter of the central circle represent primary risk control systems (RCS) that are relevant to controlling the process. Inspectors should examine these RCS to the extent that they feel necessary to be confident that each is adequate. For example, confirmation of adequate plant design for existing plant may require little more than confirming vessel design standards. Planned plant inspection, on the other hand, particularly for older vessels, may need to be examined in much greater detail.

10. The dotted circles represent secondary (in that they are subsets of the primary RCS but no less important in terms of control measures) RCS that are likely to be relevant. Figure 1 shows two examples linked to the maintenance RCS, though they may also be relevant to other primary RCS.

11. This inspection model is currently being developed and more detailed information will be provided in other chapters of this manual in due course.




Recording outcomes

• Confirm matters in writing;
• Complete CIS records;
• Update intervention plans.

12. The EMM provides guidance on when inspectors should send letters to duty holders. Inspectors may choose to confirm matters outside the EMM criteria at their discretion.

13. A timeline and inspection report should be completed on CIS following an inspection.

14. For interventions carried out based on intervention plans the plans should be updated following visits eg to confirm that the visit has been carried out.



Monitoring progress

• Check duty holder's progress with action required.
15. Inspectors are required to check compliance with all enforcement notices that they issue. Improvement notices should be checked as soon as possible after the date specified on the notice for compliance and in any case
within 10 days of it. The expectation is that compliance will be checked by site visit except when sufficient confirmation can be achieved by other means.

16. Audits describes the requirements for audit follow up reports.

17. Inspectors should usually seek confirmation that duty holders have complied with legal requirements and inspectors' recommendations in letters. The expectation is that this would be achieved by eg seeking written confirmation from duty holders or by telephone.



Review

• Assess effectiveness of intervention.

18. Inspectors may find it useful to review some of their interventions, perhaps using the five elements listed here as a guide, to consider whether alternative approaches could have been more effective. For trainee inspectors this will be a more formal process carried out with line managers and / or more senior colleagues.
		 
		Interventions

1. Interventions are planned processes designed to secure compliance with the law and include:
• Inspections and audits - including verification to test conformity with information contained in safety reports and to monitor duty holders' implementation of stated prevention, control and mitigatory measures;
• Other methods of contact such as projects;
• Interventions do not include incident and complaint investigations.
