ApplyHierarchicalStructure.Description=The modeler should create a hierarchical Business Process Model with multi layers of details for the Process. BPMN sub-processes are used to split the Process into phases or layers. The modeler can expand the sub-processes later to expose details of lower levels of hierarchy. A process model will contain multiple pages, but internally the integrity of a single model is maintained.
ApplyHierarchicalStructure.Name=Apply hierarchical structure with SubProcesses
ApplyHierarchicalStructure.SuggestionKO=Apply hierarchical structure with SubProcesses: 
ApplyHierarchicalStructure.SuggestionOK=Well done\!
BalanceGateways.Description=The modeler should always use the same type of gateway used both for splitting and joining the flow. For example, when a flow is divided with a parallel gateway, the resulting parallel flows should be consolidated via another parallel gateway. In particular, the modeler should ensure that join parallel gateways have the correct number of incoming sequence flow-especially when used in conjunction with other gateways; this is related to ensuring the soundness property. Donâ\u20AC\u2122t apply this guidelines on Event-based or Complex Gateways.

BalanceGateways.SuggestionOK=Well done\!
BalanceGateways.SuggestionSubprocessKO=\nBalance gateways in SubProcess 
ConsistentUsageEndEvents.Description=The modeler should distinguish success and failure end states in a process or a sub-process with separate end events. Flows that end in the same end state should be merged to the same end event. Therefore, separate end events that do not represent distinct end states must be merged in a single end event.
ConsistentUsageEndEvents.Name=Consistent Usage of End Events
ConsistentUsageEndEvents.SuggestionKO=\nUse only one End Event:
ConsistentUsageEndEvents.SuggestionOK=Well done\!
ConsistentUsageEndEvents.SuggestionSubprocessKO=\nUse only one End Event in SubProcess 
ConsistentUsageLanes.Description=The modeler should model internal organizational units as lanes within a single process pool, not as separate pools; separate pools imply independent processes. Create a lane, in a pool, only if at least one activity or intermediate event is performed in it.
ConsistentUsageLanes.Name=Consistent usage of lanes
ConsistentUsageLanes.SuggestionKO=\nInsert Activities in Lanes:
ConsistentUsageLanes.SuggestionOK=Well done\!
ConsistentUsagePools.Description=The modeler should define as many pools as processes and/or participants. Use a black-box pool to represent external participant/processes. The modeled pools need to be in relation with each other and have to be linked to the main process through message exchange.
ConsistentUsagePools.Name=Consistent usage of Pools
ConsistentUsagePools.SuggestionKO=\nOpen only one pools: 
ConsistentUsagePools.SuggestionOK=Well done\!
ConsistentUsageStartEvents.Description=The modeler should include, in the model, only one start event. Where necessary, alternative instantiations of the process should be depicted with separate start events and using a event-based start gateway.

ConsistentUsageStartEvents.SuggestionOK=Well done\!
ConsistentUsageStartEvents.SuggestionSubProcessKO=\nUse only one Start Event in SubProcess 
explicitGateways.Description=The modeler should not split or join flows using activities or events; the modeler should split or join sequence flows always using gateways.

This includes that an activity can have only one incoming sequence flow and only one outgoing sequence flow.
explicitGateways.Name=Explicit usage of gateways
explicitGateways.SuggestionKO=Add Gateway before or/and after of the elements: 
explicitGateways.SuggestionOK=Well done\!
ExplicitStartEndEvents.Description=The modeler should explicitly make use of start and end events.

MinimizeGatewayHeterogeneity.SuggestionOK=Well done\!
MinimizeGatewayHeterogeneity.SuggestionSubprocessKO=\nMinimize Gateway Heterogeneity in SubProcess 
MinimizeModelSize.Description=The modeler should try to keep models as small as possible. Large process models are difficult to read and comprehend. Additionally, they tend to contain more errors. Defining the correct scope of tasks and level of detail of processes is key to reduce the overage of information.
MinimizeModelSize.Name=Minimize Model Size
MinimizeModelSize.SuggestionKO=Too much elements %s. Please use max 31  the number of nodes: number of activities and routing elements in a process model
MinimizeModelSize.SuggestionOK=Well done\!
ModelLoops.Description=Where possible, and if this practice contributes to simplify the model, the modeler should model a loop via activity looping (with the loop marker) instead of using a sequence flow looping.

ProcessOrientation.Name=Process Orientation
ProcessOrientation.SuggestionKO=Change Process Orientation: 
ProcessOrientation.SuggestionOK=Well done\!
RestrictUsageTerminateEndEvent.Description=The process modeler should use terminate events only when strictly necessary; they are used to model situations where several alternative paths are enabled and the entire process have to be finished when one of them is completed. The modeler should use other end events rather than the terminate end event (e.g. a generic end event), to guarantee that the executions of the reaming process paths or activities will not be stopped.
RestrictUsageTerminateEndEvent.Name=Restrict usage of terminate end event
RestrictUsageTerminateEndEvent.SuggestionKO=\nDon't use Terminate End Event:

SplitAndJoinFlows.SuggestionKO=Split following Gateway:
SplitAndJoinFlows.SuggestionOK=Well done\!
UsageDefaultFlows.Description=Where possible, after an exclusive and an inclusive gateway, the modeler should express the default flow. One way for the modeler to ensure that the process does not get stuck at a gateway is to use a default condition for one of the outgoing sequence flow. This default sequence flow will always evaluate to true if all the other sequence flow conditions turn out to be false.
UsageDefaultFlows.Name=Usage of default flows

UsageDefaultFlows.SuggestionOK=Well done\!
UsageDefaultFlows.SuggestionSubprocessKO=\nUsage of default flows in SubProcess 
UsageInclusiveORGateways.Description=The modeler should minimize the use of inclusive gateways (OR-joins and OR-splits). Inclusive OR-splits activate one, several, or all sub- sequent branches based on conditions. They need to be synchronized with inclusive OR-join elements, which are difficult to understand in the general case.
UsageInclusiveORGateways.Name=Usage of Inclusive OR-Gateways
UsageInclusiveORGateways.SuggestionKO=\nDon't use Inclusive Gateway: 
UsageInclusiveORGateways.SuggestionOK=Well done\!
UsageInclusiveORGateways.SuggestionSubprocessKO=\nDon't use Inclusive Gateway in SubProcess
